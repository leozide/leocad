LeoCAD for Linux
----------------

	This is the only documentation you will find for the Linux
version, I'll start writing some help files in HTML format soon but
it's going to take a while (I really prefer to code and my english
is not perfect). I strongly advise you to follow the online tutorial
from my web page, it will at least get you started with the basic
editing commands.

	I still have to finish some dialogs, the printing routines
and a few GUI items but all the rest should work fine. I'd also
like to warn you that this is my first Linux program so if you
find anything that doesn't behave as you expect, a bug or just
have some suggestions, feel free to email me at
leonardo@centroin.com.br

  I hope you enjoy using LeoCAD as much as I enjoyed writing it,

Leonardo


HOW TO GET HELP

INSTALLATION
------------

  Instalation should be very simple for most systems, first you need
get the executable and the pieces library from my homepage (if you
already have the library for the MS Windows version, you don't
need to download it again).

  Now you should unzip the files to a temporary directory (you
probably already did that) and move the file 'leocad' to
/usr/local/bin/ and the 4 files from the pieces library to
/usr/local/share/leocad/. If you wish to have the library files
installed in another place, set the environment variable LEOCAD_LIB
to that directory or start the program with the -l <path> option.

  You need to have an OpenGL library, you can download Mesa 3D
from www.mesa3d.org if you don't have one already and you will also
need GTK+ 1.2, it's available from www.gtk.org

  If you're using the precompiled version, then you will also need
libjpeg, zlib and libpng. If you're compiling from the sources, the
configuration utility will detect what libraries you have installed
and only support those file formats.

Current versions used are:
GTK+ 1.2     http://www.gtk.org/
MESA 3D 3.4  http://www.mesa3d.org/
LIBJPEG 6.0  ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/
LIBPNG 1.0   http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
ZLIB 1.1     http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib/


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
--------------------

  The man (1) page has a more complete description of all command line
parameters available. This is just a list of the most used ones:

[filename]: Loads a file

-l <path>: Tells the program to use the piece library located in the directory
           pointed by <path>

-i [filename]: Saves a picture and exit

-w <x>: Use this width for the picture

-h <y>: Use this height for the picture

Example:

  leocad car.lcd -i car.gif -w 640 -h 480 -l /mnt/c/leocad/

  This will start LeoCAD, load the file "car.lcd", create a GIF file
called "car.gif" with a resolution of 640 x 480 using the pieces
library in /mnt/c/leocad/ and exit when done.
