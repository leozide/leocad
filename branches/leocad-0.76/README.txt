About LeoCAD
------------

LeoCAD is a CAD program that allows people to build virtual models using
bricks similar to those found in LEGO toys. It's available for free under
the GNU Public License, and works on the Windows and Linux Operating
Systems.


Installation
------------

You can download the latest version of LeoCAD and its Pieces Library from
the main website at http://www.leocad.org

It's recommended that you install the latest drivers for your video card,
since LeoCAD can take advantage of hardware acceleration for rendering by
using OpenGL.

- LeoCAD for Windows:

  Download LeoCAD-0.75-Windows.exe to your computer, double click on the 
  icon to launch the installer and follow the intructions.

- LeoCAD for Linux:

  You can either download the source from Subversion or use the i386 rpm
  binaries. If you decide to compile it yourself you will also need to 
  download the Pieces Library separately, extract it to any directory of 
  your choice and point the LEOCAD_LIB environment variable to it. More 
  information is available at http://www.leocad.org/linux.htm

New users can follow the tutorial at http://www.leocad.org/tutorial/
