Linux/GNU platforms
-------------------

All your config options go into config.mk

You will need jpeglib.  Install compile/install it and add it's header
directory as a -I to CPPFLAGS and -L to LDFLAGS.  This isn't required if
it is installed to "standard" locations, like /usr/include and /usr/lib

Then just type MAKE


MS Windows
----------

- Extract LIBJPEG 6.0 to the win/libjpeg directory
- Extract ZLIB to win/zlib
- Extract LIBPNG to win/libpng
- Extract the 3DSFTK to win/3dsftk (use -d to keep directory names)
- Open VC++ and do a 'Make All'
