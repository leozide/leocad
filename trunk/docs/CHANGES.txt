This is a changelog for developers only, not for ordinary users.

21/08/2000
	- New options for the Minifig Wizard, now each piece can be rotated.

19/08/2000
	- Fixed a bug when you insert a piece after a rotated piece wouldn't
	  show the new piece correctly.
	- Added a new parameter to Project::Initialize to search the program
	  directory for the piece library. Useful if a Linux user wants to
	  install everything in the same directory and keeps compatibility
	  with installations in /usr/local/share/leocad.
	- Initial attempt of a BeOS port.
