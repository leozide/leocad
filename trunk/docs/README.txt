About LeoCAD
------------

LeoCAD is a CAD program for creating virtual LEGO models. It's available
or free under the GNU Public License v2 and works on the Windows, Linux
and Mac OSX Operating Systems.


Installation
------------

You can download the latest version of LeoCAD and its Parts Library from
the main website at http://www.leocad.org

It's recommended that you install the latest drivers for your video card

rendering.

- LeoCAD for Linux and FreeBSD:

  Many distributions now include LeoCAD so check your package manager to
  see if it's already available and install from there.

  If you decide to compile it yourself you will also need to download the
  Parts Library separately and follow the installation instructions. More
  information is available at http://www.leocad.org
